            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Atika Oubellil and I am currently a student at Algonquin College, specifically enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program. This creative field allows me to explore the perfect fusion between visual design and modern digital technologies. I primarily use the <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VS Code</abbr> text editor to structure my professional web projects and learn fundamental languages such as HTML. My ultimate goal is to master these technical tools to design innovative and aesthetic user experiences that meet the needs of today's digital design market.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of my interactive media design training, I place a lot of <em>emphasis</em> on the quality of the user interface and the overall digital experience. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time I am publishing a project directly on GitHub Pages, which represents a very significant step in my professional learning journey. I am convinced that perseverance, attention to detail, and constant practice will allow me to become an accomplished interactive media designer, capable of transforming complex ideas into simple, elegant, and functional visual solutions for all types of users.
